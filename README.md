> [!NOTE]
> Since I don’t have time to continue this project right now, I’m leaving it public and archived so someone can revive it in the future, or maybe I’ll pick it up again myself someday. Have fun, everyone!

> [!WARNING]
> This script has been tested and currently works only on Unity 3D v9.1.7. I haven’t found any issues so far, and if it continues to work in future versions, that would be great!
